        <h1 class="welcome">Welcome</h1>
        <p class="welcomeText">This is the Information Technology age and at its core 
            is Computer Science. The study of computer science is 
            therefore critical if society is to take full advantage 
            of the benefits Information Technology has to offer and
             make rapid economic advances. Computer science involves 
             the study and development of applications that allow for 
             our everyday use of computers, the software systems that 
             support these applications, and the means and methods used 
             to produce both applications and systems that behave reliably, 
             correctly and ethically. At the heart of Computer Science lies 
             the skill of computer programming and employers who hire Computer 
             Scientists expect adept programmers with knowledge of current 
             techniques and tools and the ability to apply sound engineering 
             principles to the development, construction and maintenance
              of computer programs.<br><br>
              The range of courses available in the department and 
              the skills acquired by students enable them to find
               employment in many diverse fields of the economy and 
               prepare our graduates for the computing industry, working 
               in a project team (or research and development team), and
                to enable the graduate to bring specialist skills to that 
                team. The course also provides the platform for further 
                study or research through exposure to established and 
                emerging technologies and methods, and to active fields of 
                research in Computer Science.<br><br>
                The Department offers two undergraduate degree programmes, 
                Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Single-Major 
                (3:2:1:1) and Major-Minor (3:2:2:1) as well as Bachelor 
                of Science in Information Technology.</p>
